Hey my name is Tobias, also known as Biast12, i have created the Apex Legends Archives, these Archives contains a lot of Apex assets that can be used to create fanart and such on platforms that can't use Legion+ or for general use
this Archive takes a lot of time and energy to maintain and takes money so i would really appreciate if you wanted to help me out, there's one ways to do that by joining my Patreon http://patreon.com/Biast12
<br><br>
If you want some file to get added in the Archive, than please contact/message me on Twitter or Discord so i can add them
